* <b> What are NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)? </b>

“Non-fungible” more or less means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. NFTs can really be anything digital (such as drawings, music, ...), but a lot of the current excitement is around using the tech to sell digital art and building community.

At a very high level, most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin or dogecoin, but its blockchain also supports these NFTs, which store extra information that makes them work differently from, say, an ETH coin. <br>

* <b> What's the price of a Reggaeton Punks Stars NFT? </b>

* <b> I want to buy a RPS NFT but it's already sold. What can I do? </b>

No problem! Sold NFTs can be resold. Therefore, you can buy-back them form our members and become a new member of the RPS Fam. If an NFT is not listed, you can always make a bid for your fav one! <br>

* <b> So what if I just right-click on NFT and download the same file people paid their dollars for? *\*trollface*\* </b>

You can copy a digital file as many times as you want, including the art that’s included with an NFT. But NFTs are designed to give you something that can’t be copied: ownership of the work (though the artist can still retain the copyright and reproduction rights) and community membership. There's only one way of being part of the RPS Fam. That way is owing at least one Reggaeton Punks Star. <br>
