# How to buy 

`(steps: 10, time: 5')`

Buying NFTs may seem confusing at first, but once you learn the basics, it gets simpler. RPS Fam want to make this process as easy and straightforward as possible, so we have created the ultimate step-by-step guide:

1. [Open OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/reggaetonpunkstars) in your browser.

 </p>

2. Choose <b>MetaMask</b>* wallet. 

3. Install MetaMask extension in your browser**. 

4. If you don't have a MetaMask wallet, create one by clicking "Create a Wallet". If you have a previous Wallet, just import it with your secret recovery phrase.

5. Follow the MetaMasks steps to create a Wallet. *Remember the secret phrase should be kept securely by the Wallet owner, since it is unique, non-transferable and necessary.*

6. Open [MetaMask](chrome-extension://nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn/home.html). You'll see the following screen:

## A. BUY WITH CARD (easier & faster if you just want to buy 1 NFT)

"Buy with card" is a quite intuitive method. You just need to follow the steps to turn your usual currency into ETH and get your own Reggaeton Punks Star.<br><br>

## B. BUY NOW (recommended if you want to buy more than 1 NFT. Requires an extra step)

You can add funds to your MetaMask Wallet by clicking "ADD FUNDS" in your upper right Wallet icon. 

* <b>IMPORTANT: Choose the ETH - Ethereum (Polygon) cryptocurrency"</b>, since our RPS Collection lives in the Polygon Network.
* Take into consideration GAS fees. You'll probably need to add between 5%-10% more funds than the quantity you want to spend.
